# Phase-1-Independent-Project
# Premier-league-soccer-app
##Introduction.
This is a website that displays the weeked premier league matches. It displays the teams playing, the stadium the match will be played, time and also the date. The website also displays the stadiums sitting capacity and allows one to book a ticket. 

##How it works.
The website displays the first match of the day, the time to be played, time and also the venue. The website fetches data from an API which contains the matches to be played in a weekend. The website also displays the team icons. The rest of the matches appear as a list and when you click on the match it displays all the information.
